# Review Player

A professional Python-based review player framework for VFX, animation, and post-production workflows.

This project is designed as a playback and review foundation inspired by internal studio review tools used across the animation and VFX industry.

The goal of this project is to provide a lightweight, extensible, and production-friendly framework for media playback, image sequence review, OpenEXR workflows, and OCIO-based color management.

# Playlist Customization

The playlist system is designed to be customized based on studio workflows.

Enhance the playlist module:

```text
./review_player/playlist/__init__.py
```

### Projects Class

Update the `Projects` class to query project playlist data.

The returned data structure should match:

```text
./review_player/resources/presets/projects.json
```

### Versions Class

Update the `Versions` class to query media/version data.

The returned data structure should match:

```text
./review_player/resources/presets/versions.json
```

# Recommended OCIO Config

## ACES 1.3 Config

Official repository:

```text
https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenColorIO-Config-ACES
```

---

# EXR Support

The player currently supports:

* Single-layer EXR
* Multi-layer EXR
* RGB layer extraction
* Basic AOV switching

The EXR reader automatically searches for valid RGB layers.

Example supported channel patterns:

```text
R G B
beauty.R beauty.G beauty.B
rgba.R rgba.G rgba.B
Ci.R Ci.G Ci.B
```

---

# OCIO Workflow (In Progress)

Typical workflow:

```text
EXR (ACEScg)
    ↓
OCIO Display Transform
    ↓
sRGB Monitor
```

---

# Recommended Professional Workflow

| Input      | Display |
| ---------- | ------- |
| ACEScg     | Rec709  |
| Linear     | sRGB    |
| UtilityRaw | Raw     |

# Current Limitations

This project is currently an early playback framework.

Known limitations:

* OpenGL currently uses `glDrawPixels()`
* No GPU texture rendering yet
* No threaded decoding
* Video decoding may load many frames into memory
* EXR playback currently converts float images into uint8 previews
* No HDR display pipeline yet
* No audio synchronization
* No annotation system

---

# Future Roadmap

## Playback

* Threaded decoding
* Async frame prefetch
* Smart frame cache
* GPU upload pipeline

---

## Viewer

* OpenGL texture rendering
* GPU OCIO transforms
* Zoom
* Pan
* Fit modes
* Pixel inspection

---

## Timeline

* Timeline zoom
* Cached frame visualization
* Frame markers
* Notes/comments
* In/out ranges

---

## EXR Features

* Layer browser
* AOV switching
* Deep EXR support
* Metadata viewer
* Multi-part EXR support

---

## Review System

* Task integration
* Version integration
* Notes/comments
* Draw annotations
* Review sessions

---

## Integrations

* USD pipelines
* FFmpeg render export
* Editorial workflow
